### A friend of mine invited me to play an idle clicker game with them.

When it became apparent that I was rewarded for clicking on the screen, it was done.

The game was no longer an idle clicker. It was "How do I get away with not playing the game, while playing the game?"

This probably still works in current day. I don't care for the game anymore, though. This AHK is entirely for reference.
